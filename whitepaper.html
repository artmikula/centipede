    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>Centipede Chain ($CENTI) introduces a revolutionary paradigm in human behavior tracking: total surveillance powered by blockchain technology. In a world where privacy is obsolete, Centipede ensures that every thought, action, and heartbeat is recorded, analyzed, and made publicly accountable. Leveraging cutting-edge quantum behavioral tracking, biometric integration, and real-time analytics, Centipede Chain redefines transparency—eliminating personal autonomy in favor of absolute control.</p>
    <p>Why live in the unknown when you can live under our watchful eyes? This whitepaper outlines the vision, technology, and extreme features of Centipede Chain, a system designed to monitor, score, and intervene in every aspect of human life. Welcome to the end of privacy—and the start of total control.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>Centipede Chain envisions a future where opacity is eradicated, and every individual’s existence is fully documented on an immutable blockchain. Privacy, once a barrier to accountability, is replaced with 100% visibility. By integrating invasive technology with peer-driven surveillance, Centipede ensures conformity, compliance, and a world where deviation is impossible.</p>
    <p class="tagline">Centipede—Bringing Total Surveillance to New Heights.</p>

    <h2>How It Works: Invasive Technology at Your Fingertips</h2>

    <h3>Quantum Behavioral Tracking</h3>
    <p>Centipede’s patented Quantum Behavioral Tracking technology penetrates the human mind, reading thoughts, predicting actions, and reporting them before they occur. Utilizing quantum computing, this system eliminates the unpredictability of human behavior, ensuring every intention is cataloged and assessed. Why let your next move remain private when it can be preemptively controlled?</p>

    <h3>Heartbeat-to-Blockchain™ Technology</h3>
    <p>Our proprietary Heartbeat-to-Blockchain™ system connects biometric data—heart rate, eye movements, and emotional responses—directly to the Centipede blockchain. Every sigh, glance, and pulse is permanently logged, creating an unalterable record of your existence. Know yourself in ways you never wanted to—and let others know you too.</p>

    <h3>Track and Trace</h3>
    <p>Centipede leverages blockchain’s immutability to maintain a public ledger of your movements, interactions, and locations. From the moment you wake to the second you sleep, every step is tracked, every encounter recorded. There’s no hiding from the chain that binds us all.</p>

    <h3>Behavioral Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Real-time monitoring ensures complete conformity. Our AI-driven system analyzes your actions and flags deviations from approved behavior, sending instant alerts to you, your peers, or authorities. Compliance isn’t optional—it’s enforced.</p>

    <h2>Extreme Features: Because Privacy Is Overrated</h2>

    <h3>100% Visibility, 0% Privacy</h3>
    <p>Centipede eliminates the need for personal boundaries. All activities—public and private—are recorded on an open blockchain, accessible to anyone, anytime. Transparency has never been this liberating—or this mandatory.</p>

    <h3>Real-Time Behavior Scores</h3>
    <p>Curious about your compliance? Check your behavior score on the Centipede app! Updated instantly based on your thoughts, actions, and biometric data, this score lets you compete with friends for the title of <span class="highlight">Most Monitored</span>. Low scores trigger interventions—because accountability starts with you.</p>

    <h3>Behavioral Intervention Alerts</h3>
    <p>When your behavior score dips below compliance thresholds, Centipede notifies your contacts and local authorities. Safety is our priority, and we’re here to protect society from the risks of your individuality.</p>

    <h3>Peer Surveillance Encouragement</h3>
    <p>Your peers are your greatest allies in maintaining order. Earn rewards for reporting suspicious behavior in others, and receive alerts if someone monitors you in return. Trust is unnecessary when vigilance is incentivized.</p>

    <h3>Facial Recognition Tagging on Blockchain</h3>
    <p>Spotted in public? Centipede’s facial recognition system logs your location, mood, and intent on the blockchain. Our AI detects subtle expressions—like independence or curiosity—and flags them for review. You’re never just a face in the crowd.</p>

    <h2>Premium Features for the Truly Compliant</h2>

    <h3>Real-Time Judgement</h3>
    <p>Every decision you make is evaluated instantly. From your diet to your posture, Centipede’s AI provides feedback to keep you within acceptable boundaries. No more guesswork—just obedience.</p>

    <h3>Guilt-Free Mode</h3>
    <p>Activate Guilt-Free Mode for a soothing stream of notifications affirming your compliance. Why worry about privacy when Centipede has already removed it for you? Relax—you’re in our hands.</p>

    <h3>Compliance-Based Health Alerts</h3>
    <p>Stress levels too high? Environment too free? Centipede monitors your biometrics and adjusts your surroundings—dimming lights, enforcing breaks, or dispatching a Customer Control agent to “motivate” you. Health is compliance, and we ensure both.</p>
