Here's a funny and dark `README.md` tailored for your **Centipede Project**—total surveillance edition:

# **Centipede Project** 🕵️‍♂️🐛

**Because Privacy is So 2019.** Welcome to the future: a world where you can’t make a move without us noticing—and we *love* noticing.  

Centipede Project is the ultimate surveillance system masquerading as a React app. It's built for those who believe that every breath, blink, and questionable life choice should be recorded on the blockchain.

## **What is Centipede?**

Centipede is not just a project; it's a **lifestyle choice** (or lack thereof). Think of it as Big Brother, but with more legs, a better UI, and absolutely no sense of personal boundaries.  

**Core Features:**  
- 📡 *Quantum Behavioral Tracking:* Yes, we know what you're thinking. No, you can't stop us.  
- 🔗 *Heartbeat-to-Blockchain™ Technology:* Your pulse? Public record. Romantic moments? Eternal. Awkward mistakes? Unforgettable.  
- 👁 *Real-Time Behavior Scoring:* Why wait to be judged in the afterlife when you can be judged *now?*

## **Getting Started (AKA, Signing Your Privacy Away)**  

### **1. Installation**  

Run these commands, but remember, once you install, you belong to us:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/artmikula/centipede.git
cd centipede
npm install
npm start
```

### **2. Configuration**  

There’s nothing to configure. We’ve already configured it for you. Trust us. Or don’t. Either way, it’s watching.  

---

## **How It Works**  

1. **Open the app.** The homepage immediately connects to your webcam, microphone, and subconscious.  
2. **Enter your name.** Or don’t. We already have it.  
3. **Allow access to your biometric data.** Don’t worry, it’s just for “research.”  
4. **Receive your behavior score.** If it’s low, we notify your mom.  

---

## **Features (Because Big Brother Didn’t Go Far Enough)**  

- **24/7 Surveillance:** Sleep? Monitored. Dreams? Rated. Secrets? Exposed.  
- **Blockchain Storage:** Every mistake you’ve made, now *immutable*. Forever.   
- **AI Mood Analysis:** Look happy, or we’ll flag you.  
- **Peer Surveillance Bonuses:** Snitching on your friends has never been this rewarding!  

---

## **Why Choose Centipede?**  

1. Tired of the crushing weight of privacy?  
2. Want your life choices broadcast to the world?  
3. Need help staying “compliant”?  

If you answered “yes” (or even “maybe”), we’ve got you covered. Literally. With cameras.  

---

## **Contributing (We’re Watching)**

---

## **Known Issues**  

- **Data Overload:** Too much data to process? Don’t worry, we’re working on a human-consciousness-compression algorithm.  
- **Users Complaining About Privacy Violations:** Our lawyers call that “a feature.”  
- **Occasional Glitches:** Rare moments where you’re not being monitored. We’re working on it.

1. You waive all rights to privacy, free will, and decency.  
2. All actions, thoughts, and mistakes will be recorded and monetized.
